KNOWN RESTRICTIONS

* EA-0.2.1

1. No support for repeating mid-roll ad slots - the Flowplayer addChild() API only allows 1 ad to be 
   set per clip "position". This restriction will be removed shortly.
2. The Flowplayer plugin has an offset for all start of stream timing events of 300 milliseconds
   as FLV streams don't seem to allow timing events set at 0 to fire - as a result, example 13
   was not firing BA for the FLV ad
3. DEFECT: Mid-rolls are currently hanging at "duration-position"
4. DEFECT: "PlayOnce" flag is causing issues with the replay of the last stream
5. DEFECT: Close button on overlays not working
