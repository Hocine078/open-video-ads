<h2>Building the plugins</h2>
<p>
A simple build script (build.sh) is provided in the build directory to compile the release.
</p>
<p>
Before using the build script, make sure that the FLEXPATH variable is set so that it correctly
points to the location of your flex 3 sdk install.
</p>
<p>
To build the release:
<pre>./build.sh</pre>
from the release "build" directory.
</p>

<b>A Note on Debugging</b>
<p>
We use the De MonsterDebugger - you'll see it included in the source and the DebugObject declaration.
Replace this with the standard flash debugger by changing the DebugObject declarations for doLog()
and doLogAndTrace().
