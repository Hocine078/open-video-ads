#sidebar TableOfContents

0.2.1 - July 15, 2009

  * Initial release to support JW Player development

0.3.0 - August 20, 2009

  * Integrated support for overlays within the framework 
  * Extensions to support new ad server integrations
  * Major modifications to the config framework to support a unified JSON approach across the JW and Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer plugins
  * Support for firebug debug output
  * Many bug fixes

0.3.2 - September 1, 2009

  * Added NetworkResource.qualifiedHTTPUrl() so that click through URLs will always be checked that they start with "http://" before they are fired off
  * Modification of VAST parsing code for non-linear ad types - only image and swf require a "creativeType" to be defined now - text and html just need "resourceType"
  * Fixed OverlayController.hideNonLinearOverlayAd() so that overlays are hidden based on either "position" or the "regions" Ad Slot param
  * ISSUE 24: + (close) button turned off on the "system-message" region by default. This means that the "this is an ad message" doesn't show close by default
  * ISSUE 26: Support added to track "unmute" events
  * ISSUE 27: Support added to VASTController track "pause and resume" events
  * ISSUE 18: Deprecation of "selectionCriteria" config param - replaced with "adTags"
  * ISSUE 28: Changed "_activeStreamIndex" to "_playlist.playingTrackIndex" for use in onPlayer type events (e.g. on fullscreen etc.)
