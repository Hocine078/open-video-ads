#summary Change Log for the VAST AS3 Framework
#sidebar TableOfContents

0.2.1 - July 15, 2009

  * Initial release to support JW Player development

0.3.0 - August 20, 2009

  * Major upgrade - callbacks to the plugin on framework status are now "event" based
  * Integrated support for overlays within the framework 
  * Extensions to support new ad server integrations
  * Major modifications to the config framework to support a unified JSON approach across the JW and Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer plugins
  * Support for firebug debug output
  * Many bug fixes

0.3.2 - September 1, 2009

  * Added NetworkResource.qualifiedHTTPUrl() so that click through URLs will always be checked that they start with "http://" before they are fired off
  * Modification of VAST parsing code for non-linear ad types - only image and swf require a "creativeType" to be defined now - text and html just need "resourceType"
  * Fixed OverlayController.hideNonLinearOverlayAd() so that overlays are hidden based on either "position" or the "regions" Ad Slot param
  * ISSUE 24: + (close) button turned off on the "system-message" region by default. This means that the "this is an ad message" doesn't show close by default
  * ISSUE 26: Support added to track "unmute" events
  * ISSUE 27: Support added to VASTController track "pause and resume" events
  * ISSUE 18: Deprecation of "selectionCriteria" config param - replaced with "adTags"
  * ISSUE 28: Changed "_activeStreamIndex" to "_playlist.playingTrackIndex" for use in onPlayer type events (e.g. on fullscreen etc.)

0.3.3 - September 6, 2009

  * ISSUE 18: "adTags" should have been "adParameters" - fixed
  * Flash overlays loading - required Security.allowDomain() to be used. An additional config parameter "allowDomains" has been added to the AdConfigGroup - this parameter is used by the Security.allowDomain() call - "*" is the default.
  * ISSUE 5: All default overlay sizes now supported with standard region definitions
  * ISSUE 36:	Flowplayer - Ad Notice positioning on fullscreen was incorrect - placed very wide so the ad notice disappeared - fixed now
  * ISSUE 44: Have changed the logic in the region matching functions RegionController.getRegion() and RegionController.getRegionMatchingContentType() to return a DEFAULT_REGION if no match is found - this is a safety valve for the case where no sizing info is provided in the VAST template. The default template is "reserved-bottom-w100pct-h50px-transparent"
  * ISSUE 35:	'Click me call to action' region doesn't show when ad replayed - same for ad notices - the show/hide ad notice event is not firing because it's marked as hit and the show/hide 'click me' region is tied to start/end ad events that aren't firing. Changed so that ad notice events are always refired, and click me show/hide tied to that event
  * If not "creativeType" provided for a static "resourceType" image is assumed.
  * All overlay types (text, html, image, flash) successfully tested
  * Templates added to allow overlay formats to be changed as needed
  * "playOnce" configuration wasn't being set at the top level. Missing code from AbstractStreamConfig added to set it.
  * Support added to change ad notice text size from normal to small - size:smalltext|normaltext
