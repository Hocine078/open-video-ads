= The build.sh script =

A simple build script (build.sh) is provided in the build directory to compile the release.

Before using the build script, make sure that the FLEXPATH variable is set so that it correctly points to the location of your flex 3 sdk install.

To build the release:

     `./build.sh`

from the release "build" directory.

= A Note on Debugging =

We use the Firebug and [http://www.demonsterdebugger.com De MonsterDebugger] - you'll see these included in the source and the `Debuggable` declaration. Replace this with the standard flash debugger by changing the `Debuggable` declarations for `doLog()` and `doLogAndTrace()`

For more information on how to configure the debug options, refer to the section on "Debug" configuration in the [OASConfiguration Configuration guide].
