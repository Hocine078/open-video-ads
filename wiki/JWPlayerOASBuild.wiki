= The build.sh script =

A simple build script (build.sh) is provided in the build directory to compile the release.

Before using the build script, make sure that the FLEXPATH variable is set so that it correctly points to the location of your flex 3 sdk install.

To build the release:

     `./build.sh`

from the release "build" directory.

= A Note on Debugging =

We support two options - [http://www.getfirebug.com Firebug] and the [http://www.demonsterdebugger.com De MonsterDebugger] - you'll see both of these referenced in the source and the `Debuggable` declaration. If you wish to use a different debugger just replace these by modifying the `org.openvideoads.base.Debuggable` declarations for `doLog()` and `doLogAndTrace()`

For more information on how to configure the debug options, refer to the section on "Debug" configuration in the [OASConfiguration Configuration guide].
