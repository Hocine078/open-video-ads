The Open Ad Streamer is quite a complex plugin. It has a myriad of configuration options that allow ads to be configured and played in a multitude of ways.

However to get going it is quite a simple process.

Two separate guides are provided to help you quickly get up and running.

The [GettingStartedHTTP first] is a guide to delivering Ad and Show streams using the Open Ad Streamer with the HTTP progressive or pseudo-streaming protocols.

The [GettingStartedRTMP second] guide covers how to get up and running with an RTMP based streaming server.

Of course, if you want to deliver ads and show streams using a mixture of HTTP and RTMP protocols you can, but you'll have to read the [OASConfiguration Configuration Guide] to gain insight into how to achieve that.
