#sidebar TableOfContents

0.2.1 - June 30, 2009

  * The initial version - ad types supported are pre, mid, post roll linear video and companions 
  * HTTP and RTMP protocols supported
  * Overlay support being added now

0.3.0 - August 27, 2009

  * Config.as: "autoPlay" correctly implemented - only available at top level
  * Config.as: "contiguous" option name changed to "allowPlaylistControl"
  * Overlays supported

0.3.2 - September 6, 2009

  * "adTags" should have been "adParameters" - fixed
  * ISSUE 25:	Full screen positioning of "this is an ad" message is wrong - was a general problem around resizing not being done in the JW Player Open Ad Streamer
  * Companion ad timing fixed
  * Moved to final 3.1.3 Flowplayer release - "providers" config depreciated because we can't get the autoload of RTMP providers to work for instream clips - needs investigation. Manually define the provider plugins for now (see any rtmp example with an overlay to see how to do this)
  * Examples cleaned up - example19 made a single example all-example19.html
  * Some old overlay OpenX zones removed - in general zone definitions cleaned up
  * Templates added to allow overlay formats to be changed as needed
  * Example 19 fixed so that regions are right width,height and display properly
  * ISSUE 21: overlay examples included
  * ISSUE 23: problem with skipping between clips fixed on example 04 (autoPlay configuration issue)
  * ISSUE 51: Support added to change ad notice text size from normal to small - size:smalltext|normaltext
