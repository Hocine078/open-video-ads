The best way to understand how the VAST AS3 framework operates is to see it in action.

Two player plugins have been produced using the framework:

  # A Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer (get the code, review examples, read about it)
  # A Longtail Video JW Player Open Ad Streamer (get the code, review examples, read about it)

Both use the framework differently and as such, both illustrate how the framework can be used in different ways to deliver VAST compliant advertising to a Video Player.

Download the code for each, review it and walk through the detailed explanations provided for each plugin.

As you do so you will see links off to worked examples and more definitive documentation for each key framework topic as they are covered.

Enjoy ...
