This document will step through the design and implementation of the Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer.

==Download the Code==

If you haven't downloaded the source code, do so [http://open-video-ads.googlecode.com/files/openvideoads.flowplayer.openadstreamer-0.2.1.tar.gz now]. We also recommend that you download the [http://open-video-ads.googlecode.com/files/openvideoads.vast.as3.tar.gz VAST AS3 Framework code] as this isn't packaged by default with the plug-in source. You'll need to refer to both as we step through the implementation.

==Check out the Examples==

Before stepping through the detailed design of the Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer it's worth taking the time to review the  [http://www.bouncingminds.com/plugins/flowplayer/openvideoads/openadstreamer/latest/examples/index.html 30 odd examples] that have been created to show how the Ad Streamer can be configured.

Each of these examples explores a different area of behavior for both the Ad Streamer and the VAST AS3 Framework. 

==A Bit About Flowplayer==

The Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer relies on Flowplayer 3.1.3 or greater. The implementation makes use of the new Flowplayer instream API to add mid-roll video ads mid-stream. 

There are several key features of Flowplayer that need to be considered when finalising a design to integrate the VAST AS3 Framework to deliver video advertising:

  # Flowplayer provides a specific API to manage 'time-based' events in the player. This API is known as the Cuepoint API. It allows a plugin to set a specifically labeled cuepoint event to occur at a nominated point in time. This API is perfectly crafted for use by the framework to help track the progress of video advertising as it is played.

  # The second key feature of Flowplayer is it's "instream" API. This API allows "child" streams to be inserted to play at a specific point within a parent clip. This API is perfect to support the delivery of mid-roll and non-linear (overlay) 'click to play a video' advertising

  # Finally, Flowplayer provides a good clip management API that allows a plugin to build up and management a specific playlist. This API is well suited to use by the framework to build up a sequence of advertising and show clips to play sequentially in the player.
