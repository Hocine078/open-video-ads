Open Video Ads is an open source initiative dedicated to the development and distribution of free technology that enables the implementation of IAB VAST and VPAID compliant Video Players.

For video advertising to prosper, the fragmented video player market must be unified so that any video ad can be played on any player at any time.

Through the adoption and implementation of the IAB VAST and VPAID standards, the Open Video Ads technology achieves this.

Today, we have implementations for Flowplayer and Longtail's JW Player. We also have a base framework that allows any custom Flash player to become VAST/VPAID compliant.

Work is underway on implementations for the Adobe Open Media Framework and the Kaltura players.

For ads to be delivered the implementation must take with an IAB VAST compliant ad server.

Today the Open Video Ads player plugins and framework has support built in for OpenX. Further support for more ad servers is  underway and will be progressively announced/released over the coming months.
