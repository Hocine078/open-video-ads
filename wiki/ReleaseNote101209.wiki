==== Related OpenX Releases ====

A new version of the OpenX Video Ads plugin has been released to co-incide with this OAS release.

The updated OpenX Video Ads plugin (version 1.2) can be downloaded from [https://svn.openx.org/openx/trunk/etc/plugins/openXVideoAds.zip here].

The updated OpenX plugin includes a fix for the mime type provided in the "creativeType" attribute in the VAST response. Correct mime-types such as "image/png" are now provided.

The OAS plugins and AS3 framework provided in this release work with both the new OpenX Video Ad plugin version 1.2 or the previous version 1.1

==== An important change to the way ad servers are declared ====

It is important to note that in the previous release, to accommodate new ad servers, ad server declarations were changed from:

{{{
      "server": {
             "type": "OpenX",
             "vastURL": "http://openx.openvideoads.org/openx/www/delivery/fc.php"
      },
}}}

to

{{{
      "servers": [
             {
                   "type": "OpenX",
                   "apiAddress": "http://openx.openvideoads.org/openx/www/delivery/fc.php"
             }
      ],
}}}

Please update your config accordingly.
