#sidebar TableOfContents

The December 10th release includes:

  * An updated Flowplayer OpenAdStreamer (v0.4.0)
  * An updated AS3 VAST Framework (v0.5.0)
  * An updated JW Player OpenAdStreamer (v0.4.1)

==== The Key Changes in this Release ====

This release includes the following key enhancements:

  * Support in the JW Player OAS for preview images - see example X
  * Fixes around Flowplayer playlists to ensure that they work seamlessly with the OAS - see example X
  * Fixes for impression tracking on empty VAST responses. By default, impression URLs will now be fired for AdTech ad server based requests if the VAST response is empty. An option has been included to allow this facility to be turned on for other ad servers. See example X for details

==== Related OpenX Releases ====

A new version of the OpenX Video Ads plugin has been released to co-incide with this OAS release.

The updated OpenX Video Ads plugin (version 1.2) can be downloaded from [https://svn.openx.org/openx/trunk/etc/plugins/openXVideoAds.zip here].

The updated OpenX plugin includes a fix for the mime type provided in the "creativeType" attribute in the VAST response. Correct mime-types such as "image/png" are now provided.

The OAS plugins and AS3 framework provided in this release work with both the new OpenX Video Ad plugin version 1.2 or the previous version 1.1

==== An important change to the way ad servers are declared ====

It is important to note that in the previous release, to accommodate new ad servers, ad server declarations were changed from:

{{{
      "server": {
             "type": "OpenX",
             "vastURL": "http://openx.openvideoads.org/openx/www/delivery/fc.php"
      },
}}}

to

{{{
      "servers": [
             {
                   "type": "OpenX",
                   "apiAddress": "http://openx.openvideoads.org/openx/www/delivery/fc.php"
             }
      ],
}}}
