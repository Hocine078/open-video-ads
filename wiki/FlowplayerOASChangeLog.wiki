Change Log

0.2.1 - August 24 2009

  * Initial release with defects/restrictions

0.2.2 - August 26 2009

  * OpenAdStreamer.as: Fixed issue with mid-roll RTMP ad insertion - clip.start=0; added to ensure mid-roll ad starts at 0
  * OpenAdStreamer.as: Example04 - "autoPlay:false" on "pre-roll" ad not working - clip now sets autoPlay based on stream.autoPlay value
  * RegionView.as - fix to the framework - and now appears over "click here" textsign and over text on overlays
  * RegionController.as - fix to ensure RegionViews childIndex puts them on top as they are added
  * CrossCloseButton.as - fix to ensure that close button can be clicked and region closed
  * OpenAdStreamer.as - Fixed sizing is set on the DisplayProperties - derived automatically from DisplayObject()

0.2.3 - September 1, 2009

  * Issue 26: Support added for tracking of "unmute, pause and resume" events
  * Issue 18: Deprecation of "selectionCriteria" config param - replaced with "adTags"

0.2.4 - September 6, 2009

  * All HTTP examples moved to official release of Flowplayer 3.1.3 (the official release doesn't seem to work with RTMP right now as there isn't an official 3.1.3 RTMP plugin)  
  * ISSUE 36:	Flowplayer - Ad Notice positioning on fullscreen was incorrect - placed very wide so the ad notice disappeared - fixed now

0.2.5 - October 6, 2009

* ISSUE 78: "deliveryType" config option set to "any" by default - meaning in most cases,
  this option is no longer required - removed from examples
* ISSUE 40 & ISSUE 80: Change "streamType" configuration to be generalised - default is now "any"
  all-example41 created to test/illustrate new streamType configuration
* ISSUE 88:	Flowplayer custom clip properties not imported - "player" config grouping added
  at general, stream, ads and ad slot levels. See example44.html
* ISSUE 92:	Fix up the "autoPlay" usage in the examples - example04 now illustrates turning autoPlay:true
* ISSUE 87:	Issues with "applyToParts" config - many fixes - see test cases test01-12.html
* ISSUE 101: Flowplayer playlists can now be used to derive the "shows" configuration - this should
  fix the issue with bandwidth checker compatibility
* ISSUE 99:	Removed references to global.js in examples
* ISSUE 17:	Support pseudo-streaming provider
* ISSUE 59:	Restore the 'providers' configuration option for Flowplayer
