Ad scheduling is a skilled task. The successful deployment of an effective video advertising solution requires an
efficient Ad Server that manages the task of initiating, running and reporting on a video advertising campaign 
while the video player sequences and plays back the video ads identified by the Ad Server.

The following diagram illustrates the end-to-end video advertising solution using the JW Player Open Ad Streamer:

To deploy the solution you will need to run:

  # [http://www.longtailvideo.com Longtail Video's JW Player] 4.5 (or later) (JW Player is Open Source)
  # A VAST Complaint Ad Server to deliver video ad definitions to it to schedule and playback via the Longtail Video JW Player. The project currently supports [http://www.openx.org OpenX] ( [InstallingOpenXServerVideoPlugin Installation instructions]). OpenX is the leading Open Source ad solution on the market today. Other Ad Servers can be used if they are VAST compliant. Support for several others is now in development.
  # The Open Video Ads [http://open-video-ads.googlecode.com/files/openvideoads.jwplayer.openadstreamer.bin.tar.gz Open Ad Streamer] plugin for JW Player. This plugin is an Actionscript 3 FLASH SWF that is loaded by JW Player at runtime to facilitate the scheduling and playback of video advertising against a set of show streams
