The following issues have been reported with the October 9th release:

  # The player intermittently hangs when loading the Open Ad Streamer: This issue is caused by a change in the way the "controls" code has been compiled into the Open Ad Streamer. For the October 9th release we removed the Controls code from the OAS SWF, but unfortunately the code still had strongly typed "references" to the controls code base. If the controls aren't loaded before the OAS, the OAS fails to load causing the player to hang. We quickly repaired this issue by re-releasing the binary and source OAS packages with a version of the Open Ad Streamer that has the controls library merged into the SWF. The Open Ad Streamer on that release is 200K while the error prone release had the Open Ad Streamer at around 87K. If you are suffering from this issue please download the release again and use the 200K OpenAdStreamer.swf. Meanwhile we will be repairing this permanently in the next release so that the SWF is back at the 80 odd K level. This issue can be tracked as ISSUE 110
  # The Flowplayer Playlist example43 has a problem with pause/resume in the main show streams. The ads can be paused/resumed by the shows defined in a standard Flowplayer playlist cannot. This issue is a bit of a mystery. We are looking into it. The defect has been reported as ISSUE 113
