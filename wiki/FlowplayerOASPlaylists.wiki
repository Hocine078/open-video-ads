#summary How To Configure Your Show Streams
#sidebar TableOfContents

The Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer allows "show" streams to be configured using either one of two approaches:

  # Via the "shows" configuration grouping
  # Via the use of the Flowplayer playlist configuration mechanism

This guide explores how to use the standard Flowplayer Playlist mechanism. For a detailed description of how to use the internal Open Ad Streamer "shows" configuration grouping, please refer to the [OASConfiguration OAS Configuration Guide].

===Combining Flowplayer Playlists with the Open Ad Streamer===

[http://static.openvideoads.org/examples/openadstreamer/flowplayer/examples/all-example43.html Example 43] is a worked illustration of how to use Playlists with the Open Ad Streamer.

This example has the following Flowplayer configuration:

{{{
flowplayer("a.example", "../dist/flowplayer-3.1.4.swf", {
    playlist: [
       {
           url: 'http://static.bouncingminds.com/images/open-video-ads/logo.png',
           scaling: 'orig'
       },
       {
           url: 'http://streaming.openvideoads.org/shows/the-black-hole.mp4',
           duration: 20
       },
       {
           url: 'mp4:the-black-hole.mp4',
           provider: 'rtmp',
           duration: 15
       }
    ],
    
    plugins: {
        controls: {
            autoHide: "always"
        },

        rtmp: {
            url: "../dist/flowplayer.rtmp-3.1.3.swf",
            netConnectionUrl: 'rtmp://ne7c0nwbit.rtmphost.com/videoplayer'
        },

        openAdStreamer: {
            url: '../dist/OpenAdStreamer.swf',
            
            "autoPlay": false,
            
            "ads": {
              "server": {
                "type": "OpenX",
                "vastURL": "http://openx.openvideoads.org/openx/www/delivery/fc.php",
              },
              "schedule": [
                  {
                    "zone": "5",
                    "position": "pre-roll",
                    "applyToParts": [1, 2]
                  }
              ]
            },

            "debug": {
              "levels": "fatal",
              "debugger": "firebug"
            }
        }
    }
});
}}}

There are two important things to note about this configuration:

  # There is no "shows" configuration group defined in the Open Ad Streamer configuration block
  # All show clips to be configured are defined in the standard Flowplayer `playlist`

When the Open Ad Streamer starts up, it looks to see if a Playlist has been pre-defined. If it has, it reads in those clip settings and treats that list as the default "shows" list that ads are to be scheduled against.
