#summary Supporting Custom Player implementations

The Open Video Ads VAST Actionscript 3 framework is designed to allow custom player implementations to be extended to support requests for and the playback of VAST compliant video advertising.

Through the integration of the framework, a custom player can make requests to VAST compliant ad servers, process the results, schedule the ads to be played, play them and track the results.

Both the [JWPlayerOASIntroduction JW Player] and [FlowplayerOASIntroduction Flowplayer] Open Ad Streamers utilise the framework in their implementation. In both cases, a minimal amount of code is required by each player to achieve 'VAST compliance'.

The current incarnation of the framework is very much in a *beta* form - it's a little rough and ready, but it does power both plugins so the overall functionality is operational.

We're now working on cleaning up the API a little, improving overall performance and implementing a set of test harnesses.

The goal however is to provide a nice, clean VAST framework for widespread use across all player implementations.
