#summary March 22, 2010 Release Note
#sidebar TableOfContents

The March 22 2010 release is an early release candidate of the following:

  * v0.5.1 of the VAST AS3 Framework (openvideoads.vast.as3.-0.5.1-rc1.tar.gz)
  * v0.5.0 of the Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer (openvideoads.flowplayer.openadstreamer.rc1.tar.gz)

The release candidate id is "RC1"

The Longtail JW4.x and 5.x release candidates have been excluded from this release - there are still a number of critical bugs to resolve before they can be released. We hope to release a full release candidate later this week that includes the JW releases.

RC1 includes a number of key additions to both the Ad Streamer and the core AS3 framework:

  # Support for VAST2.0 (Linear ads only at this time plus companions)
  # "Out of the Box" support for DoubleClick DART - both VAST 1.0 and 2.0
  # Improved ad server URL reference via a "tag" property that has been added to the "Ad Slot" configuration
  # The ability to be able to exclude OAS configured "ads" from the Flowplayer JS playlist plugin - a slightly modified version of the plugin has been included to provide this functionality
