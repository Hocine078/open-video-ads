#sidebar TableOfContents

The October 6 2009 release has the following key changes in it:
 
  * No need to specify the "deliveryType: streaming|progressive" flag anymore - "any" is the default "deliveryType" setting now that allows both streaming and progressive streams to be mixed and delivered together
  * No need to specify the "streamType: mp4|flv" flag anymore - "any" is the default "streamType" which means that mp4 and flv can be mixed and delivered together
  * Support for "providers" added which allows custom HTTP and RTMP providers to be specified. See Flowplayer http-example39.html to see how to support pseudo-streaming providers and JW Player http-example39.html to see how to support providers such as XMOOV for pseudo-streaming
  * Support added for standard playlist definitions to the Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer - see Flowplayer http-example43.html for an illustration
  * Support added for custom clip properties to be added and carried through into the Flowplayer Open Ad Streamer - see http-example44.html for an illustration
