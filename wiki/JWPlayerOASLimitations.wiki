#summary Known Limitations of the JW Player Video Ad Streamer
#sidebar TableOfContents

The following limitations in functionality exist for this release:
  
  * Overlay 'click to play video' not permitted if "allowPlaylistControl:true" because clips must be loaded on at a time to support that functionality
  * JW Player does not have "autoPlay" implemented at an AdSlot level
