#summary Known Limitations of the JW Player Video Ad Streamer
#sidebar TableOfContents

The following limitations in functionality exist for this release:
  
  * Overlay 'click to play video' not permitted if "allowPlaylistControl:true" because clips must be loaded on at a time to support that functionality
  * "autoPlay" is not implemented at an AdSlot level

For more information on the restrictions, planned enhancements and currently outstanding defects, please review the [http://google.code.com/p/open-video-ads Issues log]
