#summary Specific configuration settings to support the AdTech Ad Server
#sidebar TableOfContents

The Open Ad Streamer supports a very flexible configuration approach to the definition of requests that are to be made to different types of video ad server.

The OAS supports [http://www.adtech.de AdTech] 'out of the box'. This guide walks through the different configuration approaches that may be taken to integrate an [http://www.adtech.de AdTech] request.

===The Basics===

The configuration example below illustrates the most straight forward configuration to support a call to an [http://www.adtech.de AdTech Ad Server]:

{{{
flowplayer("a.player614x345", "../dist/flowplayer-3.1.4.swf", {
    plugins: {
        openAdStreamer: {
            url: '../dist/OpenAdStreamer.swf',

            "shows": {
                "baseURL": "http://streaming.openvideoads.org/shows",
                "streams": [
                    {
                        "file":"the-black-hole.mp4",
                        "duration":"00:00:20"
                    }
                ]
            },

            "ads": {
              "displayCompanions": true,
              "restoreCompanions": false,
              "companions": [
                   { "id":"companion-160x600", "width":"160", "height":"600" },
                   { "id":"companion-300x250", "width":"300", "height":"250" }
              ],
              "servers": [
                   {
                      "type": "AdTech",
                      "apiAddress": "http://de.at.atwola.com/?adrawdata/3.0/515.1",
                   }
              ],
              "schedule": [
                   {
                      "zone": "2189418/0/1725", // composed of placement/page-id/size-id
                      "position": "pre-roll"
                   }
              ]
            },

            "debug": {
              "levels": "fatal",
              "debugger": "firebug"
            }
        }
    }
});
}}}

In this example, 1 ad slot (a pre-roll) is declared. 

To obtain the pre-roll ad, a single ad server is declared - one of type "AdTech".

The address for the server is specified as `http://de.at.atwola.com/?adrawdata/3.0/515.1`

In this instance, to identify the type of ad to be served by AdTech, a `zone` is declared of components that describe:

  * The ad placement position on the page
  * The page-id 
  * The size-id for the ad

In our case, that `zone` is declared as `2189418/0/1725`
