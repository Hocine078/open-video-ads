#summary Specific configuration settings to support the AdTech Ad Server
#sidebar TableOfContents

The Open Ad Streamer (version 0.3.0 or greater) supports a very flexible configuration approach to the definition of requests that are to be made to different types of video ad server.

The OAS supports [http://www.adtech.de AdTech] 'out of the box'. This guide walks through the different configuration approaches that may be taken to integrate an [http://www.adtech.de AdTech] request.

===The Basics===

The configuration example below illustrates the most straight forward configuration to support a call to an [http://www.adtech.de AdTech Ad Server]:

{{{
flowplayer("a.player614x345", "../dist/flowplayer-3.1.4.swf", {
    plugins: {
        openAdStreamer: {
            url: '../dist/OpenAdStreamer.swf',

            "shows": {
                "baseURL": "http://streaming.openvideoads.org/shows",
                "streams": [
                    {
                        "file":"the-black-hole.mp4",
                        "duration":"00:00:20"
                    }
                ]
            },

            "ads": {
              "displayCompanions": true,
              "restoreCompanions": false,
              "companions": [
                   { "id":"companion-160x600", "width":"160", "height":"600" },
                   { "id":"companion-300x250", "width":"300", "height":"250" }
              ],
              "servers": [
                   {
                      "type": "AdTech",
                      "apiAddress": "http://de.at.atwola.com/?adrawdata/3.0/515.1",
                   }
              ],
              "schedule": [
                   {
                      "zone": "2189418/0/1725", // composed of placement/page-id/size-id
                      "position": "pre-roll"
                   }
              ]
            },

            "debug": {
              "levels": "fatal",
              "debugger": "firebug"
            }
        }
    }
});
}}}

In this example, 1 ad slot is declared - a pre-roll ad. 

To obtain the pre-roll ad, a single ad server is declared - one of type "AdTech". The `type` identifies the ad server type to the Open Ad Streamer. Several pre-defined ad server types are currently supported:

  * OpenX
  * AdTech
  * Direct

After the type declaration, the address for the server is specified as `http://de.at.atwola.com/?adrawdata/3.0/515.1`

In this instance, to identify the type of ad to be served by AdTech, a `zone` is declared of components that describe:

  * placement = 2189418 = placement ID, this is the AdTech unique identifier for an Ad placement
  * page = 0 = this parameter is not in use at the moment
  * size-id = 1725 = the size ID identifies a banner of a specific size which prevents serving the wrong size on wrong placement

In our case, that `zone` is declared as `2189418/0/1725`

When the Open Ad Server reaches a point where it needs to make a request to an ad server to get the ad asset, it constructs the ad server request URL from a template that is pre-defined for the declared ad server `type`.

For AdTech, the default request URL template appears as follows:

{{{
__api-address__/__zone__/__nondynamic__;
alias=__alias____aliaspostfix__;key=__key__;__key-value__;
__cookie-name__=__cookie-value__;
grp=__group__;misc=__random-number__
}}}

A `request template` is basically a string pattern that needs to be populated by the Open Ad Streamer when making a request to an ad server. For each template, a set of default values are also specified for the ad server type so that with the minimal configuration, a successful ad server request can be made.

Using this template and our example, the request to AdTech will be formulated as follows:

{{{
http://de.at.atwola.com/?adrawdata/3.0/515.1/
2188757/0/1728/noperf=1;cc=2;header=yes;cookie=yes;
adct=204;alias=;key=key1+key2;;=;grp=[group];misc=R0.1974387434311211
}}}

The resulting URL was constructed because:

  * `__api-address__` was replaced with the "apiAddress" setting `http://de.at.atwola.com/?adrawdata/3.0/515.1`
  * `__zone__` was replaced with the Ad Slot "zone" setting `2188757/0/1728`

In addition, several default values were used (because no specific ones were declared in the example configuration)

  * `__nondynamic__` was replaced with `noperf=1;cc=2;header=yes;cookie=yes;adct=204`
  * `__alias__` was replaced with "" (nothing)
  * `__key__` was replaced with "key1+key2"
  * `__misc__` was replaced with a random number (`__random-number__` is a reserved word that tells the OAS to generate a random number string and place it in that position

This all sounds quite complicated but it's hidden behind the scene.

If you need more flexibility around the way the AdTech URL is declared in an OAS configuration, three further configuration options are available to you:

  # Specifying URLs directly
  # Overriding the default AdTech request template
  # Overriding the standard template field values with your own

===Calling AdTech Directly===

The following example illustrates how to cut and paste AdTech URLs directly into an OAS configuration so that they are called without being modified:

{{{
flowplayer("a.example", "../dist/flowplayer-3.1.4.swf", {
    plugins: {
        controls: {
            autoHide: "always"
        },

        openAdStreamer: {
            url: '../dist/OpenAdStreamer.swf',

            "debug": {
                "debugger": "firebug",
                "levels": "fatal"
            },

            "ads": {
                "pauseOnClickThrough": true,
                "schedule": [
                    {
                       "position": "pre-roll",
                       "server": {
                           "type": "direct",
                           "apiAddress": "http://de.at.atwola.com/?adrawdata/3.0/515.1/
                                         2188758/0/1725/noperf=1;cc=2;header=yes;alias=myalias;
                                         cookie=yes;adct=204;key=key1+key2;grp=[group];
                                         misc=__random-number__"
                       }
                    }
                ]
             }
         }
     }
});
}}}

_note: In this example the URL is broken over several lines - don't break the URL over multiple lines in your actual configuration_

You will notice a couple of things about this example configuration:

  * The ad server type is specified as `direct`
  * The `apiAddress` is the fully formed AdTech URL

By specifying `direct` as the ad server type, the Open Ad Streamer simply uses the `apiAddress` as the URL to call - no templates or default values are applied.

Another difference with this configuration over the previous example is that the ad server settings are defined at the Ad Slot level. It is possible to specify precisely what ad server to call per Ad Slot. In this case, we've instructed the OAS to call the AdTech URL directly.

In our example, you will have noticed that no "zone" is declared for the "pre-roll" ad slot. When a "direct" ad call is to be made, the "zone" definition is no longer required. 

===Overriding the Default Request Template===

Very complex ad server configurations can be supported by the Open Ad Streamer.

The default request template can be overridden to allow any new URL structure to be declared.

The following example illustrates how this is done:

{{{
flowplayer("a.player614x345", "../dist/flowplayer-3.1.4.swf", {
    plugins: {
        rtmp: {
            url: "../dist/flowplayer.rtmp-3.1.3.swf"
        },
        rtmpInstream: {
            url: "../dist/flowplayer.rtmp-3.1.3.swf"
        },
        openAdStreamer: {
            url: '../dist/OpenAdStreamer.swf',

                        "duration":"00:00:20"
                    }
                ]
            },

            "ads": {
              "displayCompanions": true,

                   { "id":"companion-300x250", "width":"300", "height":"250" }
              ],
