====1. Why does my player just sit/hang after a video ad plays?====

Most likely it is because you've specified an incorrect length of time for the video ad. If you've specified that the video ad is 16 seconds long, but actually it's just 15 seconds, the ad streamer will keep trying to play the missing second. Check the duration that has been specified for your ad in your ad server.

There is a second possible reason for this behavior - check the "deliveryType" configuration option that you've specified - if you've specified "progressive" but are trying to actually serve RTMP streams, the player will get confused. Alternatively a "deliveryType" of "streaming" will force the player to try to play RTMP streams only. If in doubt, set the "deliveryType" to "any".


====2. My video ad isn't playing - it's just going straight to the show stream====

The most likely cause of this either:

  # The ad server has not been able to identify an ad to server, so no ad is specified in the VAST response or
  # The ad stream specified in the VAST response from the ad server cannot be loaded and played. In most cases, this will just force the player to skip the stream and move to the next clip (in general that will be a show clip)
